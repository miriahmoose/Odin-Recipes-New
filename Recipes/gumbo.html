    <p>
      Gumbo is one of the most famous dishes to result from Louisiana's shared
      Creole-Cajun heritage. Gumbo falls somewhere between a thick stew and a
      hearty soup and can contain ingredients such as chicken, sausage, ham,
      seafood, okra, tomatoes, and greens.
    </p>

    <p>
      As varied as the recipes can be, there are a few ingredients that all
      gumbos have in common: homemade stock; the "holy trinity" of celery,
      onions, and green peppers; and roux.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¾ cup bacon drippings</li>
      <li>1 cup coarsely chopped celery</li>
      <li>1 large onion, coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>1 large green bell pepper, coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 pound andouille sausage, sliced</li>
      <li>3 quarts water</li>
      <li>6 cubes beef bouillon</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®), or to taste</li>
      <li>
        ½ teaspoon Cajun seasoning blend (such as Tony Chachere's®), or to taste
      </li>
      <li>4 bay leaves</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>
      <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons file powder, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons bacon drippings</li>
      <li>2 (10 ounce) packages frozen cut okra, thawed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>
      <li>1 pound lump crabmeat</li>
      <li>3 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step One:</strong> Make the roux: Whisk together flour and 3/4
        cup bacon drippings in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat
        until smooth. Cook roux, whisking constantly, until it turns a rich
        mahogany brown color. This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat
        carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. Remove from heat;
        continue whisking until mixture stops cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step Two:</strong> Make the gumbo: Place celery, onion, green
        bell pepper, and garlic into the work bowl of a food processor, and
        pulse until all vegetables are very finely chopped. Stir vegetables into
        the roux, and mix in sausage. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-low
        heat, and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove
        from heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step Three:</strong> Combine water and beef bouillon cubes in a
        large Dutch oven or soup pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
        Stir until bouillon cubes dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the
        boiling water.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step Four:</strong> Reduce heat to a simmer and mix in sugar,
        salt, hot pepper sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed
        tomatoes, and tomato sauce. Simmer soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix in
        2 teaspoons of file gumbo powder at the 45-minute mark.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step Five:</strong> Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons bacon
        drippings in a skillet over medium heat. Add okra and vinegar and cook
        for 15 minutes; remove okra with a slotted spoon, and stir into the
        simmering gumbo.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step Six:</strong> Mix in reserved vegetables, crabmeat, shrimp,
        and Worcestershire sauce, and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more
        minutes. Stir in 2 more teaspoons of file gumbo powder just before
        serving.
